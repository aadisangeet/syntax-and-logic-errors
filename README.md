# Buggy Python Project

This project is intentionally created with syntax and logic errors for debugging practice. The project structure is as follows:

```
syntax_and_logic_errors/
|-- main.py
|-- utils/
|   |-- math_operations.py
|   |-- string_operations.py
|-- README.md
|-- requirements.txt
```

## Known Bugs
1. Syntax errors in `main.py` and `utils/string_operations.py`.
2. Logical errors in `utils/math_operations.py`:
   - `add` function subtracts instead of adding.
   - `subtract` function adds instead of subtracting.
   - `divide` function always divides by zero.
3. String operation logic error in `concatenate_and_reverse()`.

## How to Install
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the folder.
3. Run the program using `python main.py`.

Have fun debugging!
